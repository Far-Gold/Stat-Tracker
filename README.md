# Stat-Tracker
This my first project i am coding from scratch used to keep track of stats for characters on rpg games such as DnD

And yes i know that the Take Damage isnt finished completely i need to setup a current hp variable after i finish optimizing my code.

I will also work on a way to add your own custom stats and change the exp equation and a level cap
