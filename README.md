# Stat-Tracker
This my first project i am coding from scratch used to keep track of stats for characters on rpg games such as DnD.

First time users, please press revert to defaults to fix the issue of the  values being blank.

And yes i know that the Take Damage isnt finished completely i need to setup a current hp variable after i finish optimizing my code.

I will also work on a way to add your own custom stats and change the exp equation and a level cap.
